# New Tab Page
This is my personalized New Tab page created during Execute Big's Tech Roulette Week 7. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as  [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com) to get the weather at the user's location.

## Features
- Shows the date and time in the upper right corner
- Shows the weather at the user's location in the upper left corner
- Allows the user to change their location and thus the weather
- Includes links to websites the user (aka me) frequents
- Randomized background every time the page is refreshed
