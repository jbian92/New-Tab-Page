# New Tab Page
This is my personalized New Tab page created during Execute Big's Tech Roulette Week 7. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as  [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com) to get the weather at the user's location.

## Features
- Shows the date and time in the upper right corner
- Shows the weather at the user's location in the upper left corner
- Allows the user to change their location and thus the weather
- Includes links to websites the user (aka me) frequents

## Execute Big's Tech Roulette Week 7
- Learned about the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how they are used in web development
- Practiced JavaScript by creating a website with a JavaScript-powered Konami Code (aka website Easter Eggs)
- Built a New Tab page using knowledge acquired through readings and practice with the JS-powered Konami Code
